## The safe vault of my shell script which i use in my day-to-day work
---
#### ``setwall.sh``

sets wallpaper on my macbook and since it binds the same image to clipboard, updating the clipboard would trigger a shortcut set on my iphone, would which change iPhone wallpaper as well.
---
#### ``copy_ip.sh`` 

takes ``` -p [port] ``` as an input, which would return current working ip of the mac, and binds the protocol, ip and port on the clipboard, pasting it in iPhone makes easier to access localhosts easier.
